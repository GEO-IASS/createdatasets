\description{
Diagnosis of diabetes in Pima Indian women (at least 21 years old)
}
\details{
\emph{Task}: formula(Diabetes~.)

\emph{Preprocessing}: Identify missing values and encode them as NA

\emph{From UCI description}: "Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. ADAP is an adaptive learning routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices. It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details."
