\description{
From UCI: Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participantes performing 7 activities. The dataset provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns. The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz. Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated. Number of Participants: 15. Number of Activities: 7
