\description{
From UCI: "This database encodes the complete set of possible board configurations at the end of tic-tac-toe games, where "x" is assumed to have played first. The target concept is "win for x" (i.e., true when "x" has one of 8 possible ways to create a "three-in-a-row"). Interestingly, this raw database gives a stripped-down decision tree algorithm (e.g., ID3) fits. However, the rule-based CN2 algorithm, the simple IB1 instance-based learning algorithm, and the CITRE feature-constructing decision tree algorithm perform well on it."
